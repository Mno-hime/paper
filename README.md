Paper
=====

There was always the same damn problem with each of Instapaper browser
extensions: they were unpractical to add links in a bulk. You should
open the page and only then you could send it to your Instapaper.

Then I have found [one for Safari](http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/post/675433975/safari-extensions),
great extension indeed, but I am Firefox kind of guy, so here you are. Paper!

Itâ€™s pretty customizable, but by default you add links just by Shift-clicking
on them. A button is also there. You can also make a hotkey to save the current
page without pressing the button, but it is turned off by default.
