Configure
---------

To use Paper, you need to provide your username and password. They are
sent only to Instapaper and only through an encrypted connection, but
they are both stored on your machine unencrypted.

Go to Tools→Add-ons or just press Shift+Command+A on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+A
on Windows/Linux:

![Tools→Add-ons](doc/tools.png)

Then you will see the Paper addon in the list. Click on “Preferences” button
and fill the form:

![Paper→Preferences](doc/addons.png)

![Preferences](doc/preferences.png)

Shift-clicking on a link adds it to Instapaper by default. You can change
the modifier key, or turn the feature off altogether to make your browser
a very little bit faster.

When you are finished with settings, go try to send [some article][article].
Press the ![Send to Instapaper][default] button and if your credentials are OK,
it will change to ![the tick][success]. If it didn't, double check your preferences.
